Why are we doing this? 

To understand and check the learnings and of the topics from tha last few weeks

How I expected the challenge to go. 

the challenge came as an inital shock however once i understood what i needed to do i went away and started to plan my exercise.

What went well? 
planning
research

What didn't go as planned? 
i had no idea how long things took to complete therfore couldnt accuratley account for time. I had no scope to work at the weekend as was away however if we had a bit of notice i may have been able to spend time reviewing the areas i hadnt a clue on.
i also spent a lot of time on errors and back end stuff that i didnt require. my front end isnt completed at all.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

time balance
call for help more frequently.
pinpoint areas of devevlopmet/weakness and learn them first.
